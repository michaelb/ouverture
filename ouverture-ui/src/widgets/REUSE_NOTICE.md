This is a notice of code reutilisation from the Ajour project (can be found at https://github.com/ajour/ajour), as the current directory contains 'significant reuse' of ajour code.

The LICENSE file that can be found next to this notice is a verbatim copy of Ajour's LICENSE file as of April 24th 2022.

Minor modifications have been made to those files to suit the current project's need and can be consulted in the VCS history.

Other parts of ouverture are similar in a lesser fashion to ajour, from the actual use of the code present in this directory.
