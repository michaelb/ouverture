## Stance of the ouverture project towards DRM

Ultimately, ouverture is just a tool to help users manage and listen to their music collection. While it _can_ certainly be used to acquire DRM-protected content, so can many many other tools, such as [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), and there are legal [precedent](https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/) in favor of the existence of such tools.


While ouverture will do its best to not provide DRM-infringing defaults, it will neither implement mechanisms to prevent such usage, as per my (lead developper) personal opinion, although [thinly supported](https://qr.ae/pyJCdz), with regards to the actual revenues online services pay creators. Ouverture shall (at some point) provide convenient ways of directly supporting the creators.
